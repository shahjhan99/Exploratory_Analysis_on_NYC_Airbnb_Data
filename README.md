# NYC Airbnb EDA üèôÔ∏èüìä

## Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **New York City Airbnb dataset**, focusing on understanding property availability, pricing, and neighborhood trends.  
Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, we uncover insights into the NYC short-term rental market.

## Features

  Removal of missing values, filtering outliers, and formatting datasets for analysis.
- **Availability & Room Type Analysis**  
  Understanding seasonal patterns and room-type preferences across NYC.
- **Borough-wise Distribution & Price Patterns**  
  Price trends across different boroughs and neighborhoods.
- **Visualizations**  
  Created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for clear and engaging data representation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
